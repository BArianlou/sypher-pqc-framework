# Sypher: Post-Quantum Cryptography & Reinforcement Intelligence
**Author:** Bijan Arianlou
**Identity:** The Cryptographic Shield of the Triune
**Status:** Sovereign Release 2026

## 1. Architectural Intent
Sypher is a dual-layer security framework. It fuses Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for long-term data immunity with Reinforcement-Driven Execution Intelligence for adaptive defense in adversarial environments.

## 2. Core Architecture
- **Layer 1 — Cryptographic Immunity:** Reference implementation of Kyber-style KEM and AES-256-GCM.
- **Layer 2 — Reinforcement Intelligence:** Deep Q-Network (DQN) optimized for security-aware execution paths.

## 3. Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
